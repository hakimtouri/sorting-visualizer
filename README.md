# Sorting Visualizer

## Overview
This Sorting Visualizer is a web-based application designed to help understand and visualize various sorting algorithms. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and allows users to interactively experience the mechanics of Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualization**: See how different sorting algorithms organize data in real-time.
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Control the number of elements and the speed of sorting via user-friendly sliders.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Compare the performance and sorting styles of Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for a smooth and responsive visual experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## How to Use
1. **Select the Number of Elements**: Adjust the range slider to set the number of elements you want to sort.
2. **Choose the Sorting Speed**: Use the speed slider to control how fast the sorting happens.
3. **Pick an Algorithm**: Click on either Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, or Merge Sort to start the visualization.
4. **Observe the Sorting**: Watch how each algorithm sorts the data in real-time.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structuring the web application.
- **CSS**: Styling the visualizer and ensuring responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Implementing sorting logic and interactive features.

## Running Locally
To run the Sorting Visualizer locally:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Future Scope
- Addition of more sorting algorithms.
- Implementing a step-by-step walkthrough of each algorithm.
- Integration of algorithmic performance metrics like time and space complexity.
